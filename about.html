          Kuan-Ju Wu （KJ） 吳冠儒</br>
          Born 1985, Taiwan</br>
          Lives/Works in Los Angeles, CA, USA</br>
          New Media Artist, Creative Technologist, Interaction Designer, Playful Educator.
          </br></br>
          Kuan-Ju Wu is interested in creating delightful interactions between humans, machines, and environments. He builds kinetic construction kits and tangible interfaces that borrow facets from the shapes and movements of nature, from the stories about the future machines, and the perceptual memories from our early childhood, those intuitive, rich and satisfying experiences. He has shown work in such venues as Frame Gallery, Pittsburgh; Assemble Gallery, Pittsburgh; and Interacción I/O/I, Disseny Hub Barcelona
          <!-- </br></br> -->
          <!-- On the non-artist days Kuan-Ju works as the Lead Creative Technologist and Interaction Designer at <a href="http://tellart.com">Tellart</a> , Kuan-Ju leads many of Tellart's projects from a technical standpoint, and is engaged in research and development to create new museum experiences. His focus is on creation of intuitive human computer interactions and discovering the affordances of tangible objects. With his prototyping specialities in physical computing and digital fabrication, Kuan-Ju is involved with many of Tellart’s client and internal prototyping projects. -->
          </br></br>
          Kuan-Ju sees teaching as art. In addition to illustrating technical knowledge he enjoys engaging in the constructive thinking process with students. He has led courses and workshops at universities and communities in the topics such as Making Thing Interactive (CMU), Robotic Bug Workshop (Assemble Gallery), Drawing Machine (RISD), Sensor Driven Storytelling - Internet of Trees (RISD).
          </br></br>
          Kuan-Ju Wu received his Master’s in Tangible Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA and his Bachelor in Electronics Engineering from National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan.
