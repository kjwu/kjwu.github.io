          Kuan-Ju Wu
          Born 1985, Taiwan
          Lives/Works in Providence, Rhode Island, USA
          New Media Artist, Creative Technologist, Interaction Designer, Playful Educator.

          Kuan-Ju Wu is a Rhode Island based artist who is interested in creating delightful interaction among human, machine, and environment. He builds kinetic construction kit and tangible interface that borrows facets from the shapes and movements of nature, from the stories about the future machines, and the perceptual memories from our early childhood, those intuitive, rich and satisfying experiences. He has shown work in such venues as Frame Gallery, Pittsburgh; Assemble Gallery, Pittsburgh; and Interacción I/O/I, Disseny Hub Barcelona

          On the non-artist days Kuan-Ju works as the Lead Creative Technologist and Interaction Designer at Tellart, Kuan-Ju leads many of Tellart's projects from a technical standpoint, and is engaged in research and development to create new museum experience. His focus is on creation of intuitive human computer interactions and discovering the affordances of tangible objects. With his prototyping specialities in physical computing and digital fabrication, Kuan-Ju is involved with many of Tellart’s client and internal prototyping projects.

          Kuan-Ju sees teaching as art. In addition to illustrate technical knowledge he enjoys engaging in the constructive thinking process with students. He has lead courses and workshops at universities and communities in the topics such as Making Thing Interactive (CMU), Robotic Bug (Assemble) ,Drawing Machine (RISD), Sensor Driven Storytelling - Internet of Trees (RISD).

          Kuan-Ju Wu received his Master’s in Tangible Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA and his Bachelor in Electronic Engineering from Taiwan.
