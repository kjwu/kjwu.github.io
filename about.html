            <h4>Kid's Colorful Kinetic Construction Kit</h4>
            <p>Grew up in Hsinchu - the tech city of Taiwan, I was trained as an Engineer. With great curiosity about how things are made and why we make them, I started designing, tinkering, fabricating and making things. </p>
            <p>Stayed in Pittsburgh, I received a Master degree of Tangible Interaction Desing at Carnegie Mellon University and built Robotic Construction Kit, Playful Learning Experience, and Kinetic Sculpture </p>
            <p>Now living in Providence, as a creative technologist at Tellart, I am involved with many of Tellartâ€™s client and internal prototyping projects. Also a cake baker out side of work</p>
