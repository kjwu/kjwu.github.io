Sensor Driven Story Telling - Internet of Trees is a 3 credit Special Topic Course at Rhode Island School of Design Industrial Design Department.</p>

<p>In this course, we took simple examples of nature phenomena, and represent them into a world of storytelling and interaction design, through sensing technology and data visualization. Throughout the course students had the opportunity to design and build a monitoring device, while learning foundations of systems design, embedded electronics, software development, communications networking, and mechanical interaction. Starting from a simple system at the beginning of the course, students will embark on an iterative design journey in order to evolve their “internet of thing”, and consider the entire system, including its inputs, processing and outputs.</p>
