The Singapore Economic Development Board wanted a visually iconic statement piece for high-end conferences that would connect global professionals in a spectacular way, against the backdrop of commerce in Singapore. The Coffee Connector playfully encourages business networking by offering attendees an exquisitely brewed cup of coffee â€“ but only when they pair up with a stranger and start a conversation.
