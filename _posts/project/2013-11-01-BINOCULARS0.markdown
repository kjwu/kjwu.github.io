####Binoculars

In November 2013, to help celebrate the Sydney Opera House's 40th birthday, Google Creative Lab and [Tellart](http://tellart.com) installed a special pair of binoculars on the footsteps of one of the world's most iconic buildings.

When visitors peered in to a pair of vintage binoculars, they were transported 40 other iconic sites around the world - including the Colorado River, the Palace of Versailles, and Shackleton's hut in Antarctica - using imagery from Google Street View.
