#### Plunk-O ####

<!-- ![img1]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/project/binoculars/b1.jpg) -->

On july 6, 2011, [Eric Brockmeyer](http://ericbrockmeyer.com/Robbbutterfly) and Kuan-Ju Wu put together a workshop/exhibition: Random Output at the community friendly space [ASSEMBLE](http://assemblepgh.org/), in Pittsburgh. Visitors consisted of students and professors from Carnegie Mellon University, local artists and neighborhood children. A night before the show a workshop/soldering party was held during which some of the exhibition materials were assembled.

Two projects were developed for this event: Plunk-O and Robbbutterfly. Plunk-O is a ball run which uses steel balls extracts from old computer mice to roll across copper foil switches. Capacitors were removed from scrapped motherboards to smooth the led light.
