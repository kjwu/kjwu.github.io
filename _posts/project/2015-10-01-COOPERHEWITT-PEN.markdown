####Cooper Hewitt Pen

The Pen – a device given to visitors that allows them to save and collect anything they see (via NFC-enabled wall labels) and make on the interactive tables. Connected via our API to visitors’ tickets, The Pen creates a persistent diary of each visit and the collection becomes an open resource for future exploration and inspiration
