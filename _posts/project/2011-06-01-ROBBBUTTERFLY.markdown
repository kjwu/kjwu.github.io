Robbbutterfly was also a part of the exhibition at [ASSEMBLE](http://assemblepgh.org/) and was madde with [Eric Brockmeyer](http://ericbrockmeyer.com/Robbbutterfly). Robbbutterflys are small light sensitive toys which flutter and shake when in the dark, allowing users to engage them using only a projected light source and their own shadows. These projects were used to stimulate workshop attendees to learn analog electronics and basic soldering and assembling skills, while providing a playful and engaging exhibition.
