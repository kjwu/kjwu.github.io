####Drawing Machine

Drawing Machine KIT is designed for a studio course taught by Mikhail Mansion and Kuan-Ju Wu at Rhode Island School of Design Industrial Design Department.

It's a descendant of [Sketchbot](http://tellart.com/2014/12/cooper-hewitt-sketchbot/) but aiming for lower cost ($50) and easier to access (Arduino+processing). The purpose of the course is to encourage Design student to engage design for functional machine and to explore the transition of data. (digital to physical).
