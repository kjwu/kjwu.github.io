#### Natura Machina: Newborn ####

Moss, silicone rubber, electronics 12” x 12” x 1”

A new species was born. The world of Alexa and Millennial Homo Sapiens had vanished. Hidden forces were transforming the Earth's climate, with ameliorative consequences for the American landscape. Natura Machina - a hybrid Symbiosis between machine and nature.

Newborn is an interactive pneumatic sculpture. It simulates a new kind life form - a machine and nature combined.
The movement of the sculpture mimics a baby's breathing pattern - fast and shallow. But when someone touches it, the breathing becomes slow and deep, just like calming the baby.
