#### Signs of Water ####


Presented by ecologist Dr. Masashi Soga, "Extinction of Experience"[1] highlights the detrimental consequences of lacking human-nature interactions in daily life. Nature HCI researchers aim to renew this relationship through technological mediation [2]. However, when designing with digital technology, challenges include distractions from real nature, indirect digital interactions, exclusion of non-human entities in design, lack of in-situ engagement, and brevity of interactions.

Addressing these challenges presents an opportunity to design immersive experiences involving more-than-human beings, fostering serenity, directness, in-situ presence, and temporal depth. Crucially, these experiences should integrate natural materials or phenomena to amplify authenticity and deepen connections to the natural world.

‘Signs of Water’ is an ongoing research that utilizes water, a material essential for life and nature, to explore the integration of its materiality with computer-controlled expression. Ultrasonic vibrations applied from beneath the plate’s bottom surface create swells on the water. These elevations are dynamically and sensitively controlled by computational programming, forming a variety of movements on the water’s surface. Despite being under digital manipulation, the water retains its inherent properties through reflections and ripples, reverting quickly to its natural state after the swells subside. This piece raises a question: how can media technology be used to create (or recreate) a rich interplay or relationship between nature and humans?
