Portrait Wall is a photo wall showcasing what campus life is like in Knox College. A collage of historical figure portraits and modern student activities, the wall tells the story of this liberal art school's legacy and how it continues with the young generation.

When a view touch a category icon from the capacitance sensing panel, the wall update all the displays asynchronously.
