#### Cutter ####

Cutter is a tangible interface for generating digital models by hand crafting polystyrene foam. The user pulls, pushes, and rotates a custom hotwire cutter to sculpt foam cubes. The position of the cutting path is processed in real-time to visualize the cutting process and generate a 3D model.

Cutter is part of Interactive Fabrication research collaborating with [Karl D.D. Willis](http://www.karlddwillis.com/) and [Cheng Xu](http://cheeriocheng.com/).
Interaction Fabrication is accepted to present at the fifth international conference on Tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction (TEI 2011). The full paper can be viewed [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/project/cutter/p69-willis.pdf).
