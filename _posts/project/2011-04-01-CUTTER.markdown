#### Cutter ####

Cutter is a tangible interface for generating digital models by hand crafting polystyrene foam. The user pulls, pushes, and rotates a custom hotwire cutter to sculpt foam cubes. The position of the cutting path is processed in real-time to visualize the cutting process and generate a 3D model.
