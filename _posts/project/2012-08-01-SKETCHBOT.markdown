#### Sketchbot ####

The Sketchbots were originally conceived as one of five experiments devised for an interactive exhibit at the Science Museum, London called Chrome Web Lab. These five experiments were created to demonstrate how modern Web technologies can be used together for purposes that go beyond “normal” webapps.

Web visitors interact with Sketchbots by first taking a photo of their face via a webcam. Software then renders the image into a line drawing. This line drawing is sent to a Sketchbot, which resides at the Science Museum in London, whereupon the Sketchbot draws the visitor's portrait in a sandbox.
