#### Signs of Water — Mirror ####

(This work has been published as a [full paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1usq68YRh5gnrMNGZdsFdTcvIIAjRgHPQ/view?usp=drive_link) in ISEA 2025 )


If Narcissus glimpsed his reflection in water today, would he be entranced—or take a selfie? This paper explores the interplay of self, technology, and environment, examining the dual crises of Digital Narcissism and the Extinction of Experience through the lens of technological mediation – the forces increasingly disconnect us from our authentic selves and the natural world. Signs of Water – Mirror builds on this critique as an installation featuring 30 water-filled dishes embedded with ultrasonic transducers, set within a decaying space. The work invites viewers to engage with murky reflections of themselves, interwoven with found objects symbolizing the environment, while mechanical and digital interventions disrupt the scene. Through this multi-sensory experience, the piece questions the alienation of modern life, offering a gesture toward reconnecting with oneself and the surrounding world.
