GIFFI is a computationally enhanced construction kit that enables children to build kinetic forms through purposeful play and discovery.It offers three types of movement blocks: axial / rotational, hinge / swinging, and extension / telescoping.

User can set the blockâ€™s speed and range of movement with programming board. Adding a rotational block makes the squiggly snake robot turn its head.

GIFFI project was accepted to show case at the Sixth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction (TEI 2012). The full paper can be viewed [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/project/giffi/121-Wu.pdf)
