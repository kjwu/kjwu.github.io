GIFFI is a computationally enhanced construction kit that enables children to build kinetic forms through purposeful play and discovery.It offers three types of movement blocks: axial / rotational, hinge / swinging, and extension / telescoping.

User can set the blockâ€™s speed and range of movement with programming board. Adding a rotational block makes the squiggly snake robot turn its head.
