#### Dance Graphic ####

Dance Graphic decomposes and reconstructs the dance movement from Japanese House Dancer Hiro. The diagram aims to reveal spatial patterns and structures of different moves in house dance choreography. One gesture is captured every 2 seconds, and every six gestures compose a move. By overlapping these gestures, the shape of a move can be seen.

Extracted from the recorded data, I took a particular movement "dolphin jump" and went further to construct the path of the feet to create a 3D representation, later on printed it in SLS 3D printer.
