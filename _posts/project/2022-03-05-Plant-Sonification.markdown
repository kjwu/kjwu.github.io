#### Plant Sonification Project ####

Plant Sonification is an onging R&D project collabrated with the electronic musician [Nick Tsai](https://linktr.ee/nicktsai140), to exploring plant as a source of inspiration as well as an actual input signal for realtime music creation.

I developed the plant sensor modules that turn the capacitance signals of plants into sound waves. In addition to the plant sensor, I developed a set of audio-triggered LED driver modules for the Plant Sonification Show at @mugeneration191 Cafe in Chiayi, Taiwan.
