Collabrated with the electronic musician [Nick Tsai](https://linktr.ee/nicktsai140), Plant Sonification is an onging R&D project exploring plant as a source of inspiration as well as an actual input signal for realtime music creation. 

In addition to the plant sensor, a set of audio-triggered LED driver module was developed for the Plant Sonification Show at @mugeneration191 Cafe in Chiayi, Taiwan.
