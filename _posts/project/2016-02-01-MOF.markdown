They are part of the "Augmentation Spa" session. Imaging in the near future of 2034, when machines could evolve to enhance our body and mind, what does that mean for society and the our families?

Moodview boosts users's social intelligence by providing real-time analysis of the emotions of others, offering instant feedback on what to say and how to act for maximum social impact."_  _(Tellart)_
