<p>Robbbutterfly was also a part of the exhibition at <a href="http://assemblepgh.org/">ASSEMBLE</a> and was madde with <a href="http://ericbrockmeyer.com/Robbbutterfly">Eric Brockmeyer</a>. Robbbutterflys are small light sensitive toys which flutter and shake when in the dark, allowing users to engage them using only a projected light source and their own shadows. These projects were used to stimulate workshop attendees to learn analog electronics and basic soldering and assembling skills, while providing a playful and engaging exhibition.</p>
