<p>â€œFor what is Nature? Nature is no great mother who has borne us. She is our creation.â€ - Oscar Wilde, The Decay of Lying</p>

<p>What do we picture when we imagine â€œNatureâ€? Dense vegetation, birdsong, the hum of insects, running water, gusts of wind, and gentle rain: interdependent ecosystems of flora and fauna. Modern life, in contrast, excels at excluding nature at all costs: cities of concrete, drywall, insulation, and vast technological networks protect us from the millennia we spent living â€œoutsideâ€ throughout our shared history. Today we confront these two discrete networks of lifeâ€”both electrified with possibilityâ€”as so often framed in stark opposition. What would it mean to complete the circuit once more?</p>

<p>â€œSigns of Lifeâ€ is an interactive terrarium of pneumatic and bioluminescent flora and fungi that interacts with gallery goers in enigmatic but determinable ways. As a representation of nature-machine symbiosis, and an implicit gesture towards growth out of decay, it invites its viewers to wonder: â€œWhat comes next?â€ By todayâ€™s standards this question may seem quaint, or even dated. â€œWhat comes next?â€ is a modernist idea: an era ends, and is followed by the unknown. We gaze into â€œWhat comes next?â€ not really as participants, but as speculators. This idea informs the thesis of Frank Kermodeâ€™s 1967 book The Sense of an Ending, in which he argues that every generation seeks to narrativize itself as the last. Yeats, he writes as an example, imagined a future beyond order and beyond reckoning. â€œWe live in the mood of end-dominated crisis,â€ Kermode declares, as if to contextualize our concerns as mere cyclical self-indulgence: we want to believe weâ€™re on the precipice of annihilation to give our stories shape. Kermode didnâ€™t realize, of course, that in 1967, even as he typed his argument line by line, that the delicate balance of Earthâ€™s climate had already started to tip warmer.</p>

<p>Postmodernity, on the contrary, rejects sequence: it is not â€œWhat comes next?â€ but â€œWhat happens now?â€ After Kermode, we came to distrust metanarrative, and to consider the present less as a history that cycles than as an effectively random collage of meaningless events. Is postmodernity ending? What comes next?</p>

<p>Today we must consider both of these conditions for the world we inhabit: that narrative may simply be how we constellate randomness into meaning, yet nevertheless as a species we confront a looming existential threat in global climate change. â€œSigns of Lifeâ€ explores this intersection: a post-human technomaterial ecosystem which is also defined by humans having-been. Fungi glow and flowers respire based on the â€œsigns of lifeâ€ that humans in the gallery leave behind: breaths of CO2, humidity, and sounds. The system thrives in the absence of humans, but presumes humans as an antecedent. As a terrarium, â€œSigns of Lifeâ€ is cultivated; as a mechanism, it is assembled.</p>
