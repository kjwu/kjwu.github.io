<p>Moss, silicone rubber, electronics 12‚Äù x 12‚Äù x 1‚Äù</p>

<p>A new species was born. The world of Alexa and Millennial Homo Sapiens had vanished. Hidden forces were transforming the Earth‚Äôs climate, with ameliorative consequences for the American landscape. Natura Machina - a hybrid Symbiosis between machine and nature.</p>

<p>Newborn is an interactive pneumatic sculpture. It simulates a new kind life form - a machine and nature combined.
The movement of the sculpture mimics a baby‚Äôs breathing pattern - fast and shallow. But when someone touches it, the breathing becomes slow and deep, just like calming the baby.</p>
