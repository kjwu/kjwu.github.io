<p>One day someone donated an assembly of a old projector lens to the lab. It was in a very good condition but I wasnâ€™t sure what to do with it so it has been sitting on my desk for a while.</p>

<p>Thinking about the concept of a projector which is to turn something small into a big picture, I decided to build a projection microscope. It turned to be a fun DIY project and a good educational tool for discovering nature.</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<p>1x Aluminum Handle Bar
1x 5k Lumen 50W LED
1x Old Minolta Projector Lens
1x Sheet Metal
1x Laser Cut Acrylic/Wood</p>
