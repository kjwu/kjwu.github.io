<p>On july 6, 2011, <a href="http://ericbrockmeyer.com/Robbbutterfly">Eric Brockmeyer</a> and Kuan-Ju Wu put together a workshop/exhibition: Random Output at the community friendly space <a href="http://assemblepgh.org/">ASSEMBLE</a>, in Pittsburgh. Visitors consisted of students and professors from Carnegie Mellon University, local artists and neighborhood children. A night before the show a workshop/soldering party was held during which some of the exhibition materials were assembled.</p>

<p>Two projects were developed for this event: Plunk-O and Robbbutterfly. Plunk-O is a ball run which uses steel balls extracts from old computer mice to roll across copper foil switches. Capacitors were removed from scrapped motherboards to smooth the led light.</p>

<p>This community co-creation blended analog electronics, digital fabrication, community engagement, and ultimately a collaborative installation. While the designers developed the circuit boards and component pieces, attendees arranged the ball runs on Plunk-O and arranged the Robbbutterflys and interacted with both pieces.</p>

<p>Importance to Open Hardware Community.</p>

<p>For this talk we want to share a wonderful experience in our open hardware co creation event - Random Output at Assemble Gallery Pittsburgh. It was a one week project which involved 18 community helpers and 156 visitors during the first exhibition night. The goal of the workshop / exhibition was to engage community youths and collaborate with young artists on simple electronic art projects.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/project/plunk-o/Flow.png" alt="img0" /></p>

<p>We structured the event using the following steps: Brain Storming &gt; Gold Mining &gt; Pre processing &gt; Robot Building &gt; Exhibition (as shown above). With the exception of the digitally fabricated components, all processes were done through a collaboration between the Designers and community youths.</p>

<p>Brain Storming: Come up with ideas and discuss feasibility.</p>

<p>Gold Mining: 	Find electronic components and construction material from recycling. (old PC, abandoned TVs, used woodâ€¦)</p>

<p>Pre processing: Using digital fabrication tools from local fab lab to prepare the assembly parts.</p>

<p>Robot Building: Assemble the project. (soldering party, wire stripping social networkâ€¦)</p>

<p>Exhibition: The assembly space is the exhibition gallery. During the opening we hope to spark conversations between creative youths, local artists, college students, professors, media, and parents.</p>

<p>By following this procedure we hope that a strong community connection can be built up and the knowledge of making things can be spread. Holding co creation events, we can create a space where anyone can engage in art and technology while making physical and nonphysical community connections.</p>
