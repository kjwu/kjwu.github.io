<p>Cutter is a tangible interface for generating digital models by hand crafting polystyrene foam. The user pulls, pushes, and rotates a custom hotwire cutter to sculpt foam cubes. The position of the cutting path is processed in real-time to visualize the cutting process and generate a 3D model.</p>

<p>Cutter is part of Interactive Fabrication research collaborating with <a href="http://www.karlddwillis.com/">Karl D.D. Willis</a> and <a href="http://cheeriocheng.com/">Cheng Xu</a>.
Interaction Fabrication is accepted to present at the fifth international conference on Tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction (TEI 2011). The full paper can be viewed <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/project/cutter/p69-willis.pdf">here</a>.</p>
