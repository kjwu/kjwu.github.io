<p>Inspired by the natural movement of male frog’s vocal sacs and water lily’s blossoms. Frog-O-Lily is a pneumatic light sculpture that illustrates an imagined species mutated from its flora and fauna ancestors. Constructed of 72 3D printed elastic flower pedals and pump-powered casted silicone bladder, illuminated flowers blossom and close either randomly or in sequence according to its own reactive programming, and at the same time producing croak like acoustic experience.</p>
